# Algorithms
Implement all the things.
----------

Working on implementing as many data structures, algorithms, and misc. challenges as I can to prepare for interviews.

----------
## TOC (so far)

Hoping to implment everything in *at least* Python (3.5), then the rest:
- [ ] JavaScript/Node.js
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] GoLang

Sorting:
- [x] insertion sort
- [x] binary search
- [x] selection sort
- [x] merge sort

Misc:
- [x] palindrome
- [x] binary search algorithm

Challenges:
- [x] convert 12hr time to 24hr time
- [x] compute absolute difference of primary and secondary diagonals of a NxN matrix
- [x] print staircase of N levels
- [x] determine positive/negative/zero makeup of an array
